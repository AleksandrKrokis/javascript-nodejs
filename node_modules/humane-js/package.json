  "readme": "# humane.js\nThis project was heavily inspired by [humanmsg](http://code.google.com/p/humanmsg/) project for jQuery.  I really\nliked the project but I wanted to remove the jQuery dependency, add support for CSS transitions, and have more \ncontrol over the timing.\n\n## About\nhumane.js tries to be as unobtrusive as possible to the user experience while providing helpful information that is\nclear and grabs the users attention.  It is framework independent.  Customizable.\n\n## Setup\nSetup is simple:\n\n  - Download tar/zip\n  - Select a [theme](humane-js/wiki/Themes) from `themes` dir.\n  - Include the theme CSS in your page\n  - Include `humane.min.js` in your page\n\n## Demo/Usage\n\nYou can see a [demo and usage here](http://wavded.github.com/humane-js/)\n\n## Custom Themes\n\nGot a neat theme/animation, love to see it.  View `theme-src/bigbox.styl` for an template to get started (uses [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) w/ Nib and Canvas).\n\nTo get setup with Stylus use [npm](http://npmjs.org):\n\n```sh\n(sudo) npm install -g stylus nib canvas\n```\n\nWith Stylus installed you can watch for changes and compile into CSS by running:\n\n```sh\nmake watch\n```\n\n## Desktop and Mobile Browser Support\n\nhumane.js has been tested for the following browsers.\n\n  - Internet Explorer 7+\n  - Firefox 3+\n  - Chrome 9+\n  - Safari 3+\n  - Opera 10+\n  - iOS 4+\n  - Android 2+\n\n## AMD and Node.js Support\n\nhumane.js works for AMD systems like [require.js](http://requirejs.org/) and within Node.js CommonJS module system like [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify).\n\n## Contributers\n\nMany thanks to the JS/Browser wizards that helped make this better, community rocks!\n\n- @bga_ (Alexander)\n- @joseanpg (Jose)\n- @OiNutter (Will McKenzie)\n- @ianmassey (Ian Massey)\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Marc Harter &lt;wavded@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n",
